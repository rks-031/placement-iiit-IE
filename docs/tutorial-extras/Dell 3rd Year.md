### Technical Round  

**Brief Project Discussion**:  
- The interviewer asked me to explain all the projects I had worked on. They focused on the keywords used in the project section and asked for explanations.  
- All three of my projects were based on ML, so I was asked to explain the ML algorithms implemented in them.  

**For example**:  
- In one of my projects, the Random Forest algorithm gave the best score. I was asked to explain the mathematics behind Random Forest and how it differs from Decision Trees. Since XGBoost was also mentioned in my project section, I was asked about the regularization techniques used in XGBoost, the difference between boosting and bagging, and the tree-pruning process in XGBoost.  
- In my second project, I used the Prophet model. I was asked if Prophet can be used for multivariate time series and to discuss the broad practical applications of the project (which was based on a supply chain dataset).  
- In my third project, I used Beautiful Soup as my web scraping tool. I was asked a few basic questions about its functionality.  

**Additional Question**:  
- Towards the end, I was asked how I would reduce features if given a huge dataset (considering time and space optimization). I explained Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  

**Behavioral Question**:  
- I was asked how I would handle a situation if a disagreement arose between my teammates over a suggestion.
