## Interview Process

### Round 1: Technical Round (30-40 mins)

**Q1: Buy and Sell Stocks 1, follow-up question Buy and Sell Stocks 2.**  
*(Was told to write using Classes and Objects)*  
Links:  
- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock I](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)  
- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/)  

**Q2: Find the count of the number of times an element is repeated in a string.**  
- Used `unordered_map`. Discussed time complexity, collisions, and amortised time complexity.  
- Suggested using a vector of size 26 (if all characters are alphabets and in the same case).  
*(Was told to write using Classes and Objects)*  

**Q3: (Bonus Question)**  
- Favourite Data Structure: **Trees**  
- Problem: **Find Duplicate Subtrees** (only approach discussed)  
  - Solution discussed using DFS and `unordered_map`  
  - Wrote pseudo-code to explain the approach

### Round 2: Technical Round (50-60 mins)

1. **Find trailing zeros in `n!`.**
2. **Missing data handling:** Avoided mentioning mean, median, etc.
3. **Puzzle:** [Find the ages of daughters](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-2-find-ages-of-daughters/)
4. **Find the coefficient of `x⁹` in:**  
   \((1 + x)(1 + x^2)(1 + x^3) \dots (1 + x^{100})\)  
5. **Puzzle:** [Jar with contaminated pills](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-7-find-the-jar-with-contaminated-pills/)
6. **Normalisation function:** Convert array elements into the range `[0, 1]`.
7. **Expected number of trials:** To get `N` consecutive heads.
8. **Complex roots probability:** Given equation:  
   `16x² + 8(a + 5)x - 7a - 5 = 0`
9. **Ball puzzle:** Find the defective ball among 8 identical balls with exactly 2 measurements.
10. **Proof:** Show that:  
   `f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 6x² - 4x + 1 ≥ 0` for all `x ∈ ℝ`
11. **Probability game:** Rolling two fair dice:  
   - Win conditions: Sum ≤ 6: $2, Sum = 7 or 11: $5  
   - Otherwise: Lose $1  
   - Calculate the expected value and determine if the game is fair.
12. **Random walk probability:** Return to `x = 0` after `2n` steps.
13. **SQL Joins:** Number of records in `INNER JOIN` vs `LEFT JOIN`.
