## Online Assessment Round  

**Duration:** 1.5 hours  
**Content:**  
- The assessment was a mix of multiple-choice questions and coding problems.  
- **No. of MCQ Questions:** 15 (focused on core Computer Science fundamentals)  
- **No. of DSA Questions:** 8 (mainly based on **Strings** and **Dynamic Programming**)  
- **Mode:** Online  

---

## Technical Round 1 (25–30 Minutes)  

### Introduction  
The round began with a brief introduction.  

### DSA Questions  

1. **Search in a Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode #153)**  
   - Initially proposed the **brute-force approach** using linear search with **O(n)** time complexity.  
   - Then discussed the **optimal solution** using a **modified binary search**, reducing the complexity to **O(log n)**.  
   - The interviewer asked me to **live code** the binary search approach in an online compiler.  

2. **Next Greater Element (Similar to LeetCode #503, non-circular array)**  
   - Began with the **brute-force method** using nested loops (**O(n²)**).  
   - Then explained the **optimized stack-based solution**, improving it to **O(n)** time complexity.  
   - After comparing **time and space trade-offs**, I implemented the **stack solution live**.  

### DBMS Questions  
- Explained **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) with **real-world examples**.  
- Follow-up: How **Durability** is maintained in DBMS (e.g., via **logs** and **write-ahead logging**).  

### CS Fundamentals / Projects / Domain / Internship Questions  
- None in this round.

## Technical Round 2 (25–30 Minutes)  

### Introduction  
This round also began with a short introduction, followed by a detailed discussion about my **projects** listed on the resume.  

### DSA Questions  

1. **Is Subsequence (LeetCode #392)**  
   - Provided the **optimal two-pointer solution**.  
   - Discussed **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space complexities.  
   - Implemented the solution live.  

2. **Valid Parentheses (LeetCode #20)**  
   - Explained the **stack-based approach** for checking balanced parentheses.  
   - Discussed **edge cases**, along with **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space complexities.  
   - Implemented the solution in the shared compiler.  

### Other Questions  
- **DBMS Related:** None  
- **CS Fundamentals:** None  
- **Projects:** Gave a detailed **walkthrough of one project** from my resume.  
- **Domain Questions:** None  
- **Internship Experience:** None

## HR Round (40 Minutes)  

### Questions Asked  

- **Introduction:** “Tell me about yourself.”  
- **Internship Experience:**  
  > “If you have done any internships, please tell me about your experience and what you learned.”  
- **Behavioral Questions:** None  
- **Company Profile Questions:** None  
- **Technical / Aptitude Questions:**  
  - Write two **SQL queries**:  
    1. From `Employees` and `Departments` tables, find the **third-highest salary in each department**.  
    2. From an `Orders` table (with a `status` column: `'completed'`, `'pending'`), find the **count of total, completed, and pending orders**.  
- **Others:** None

## Extra Note  

The entire interview process was **smooth and well-structured**. The main focus was on **core DSA** and **problem-solving** skills. Both **technical rounds involved live coding**, so it’s essential to be comfortable with **online compilers**.  

Additionally, since the **HR round** included **SQL-based questions**, it’s a good idea to prepare basic **query writing** and **database concepts** in advance.
