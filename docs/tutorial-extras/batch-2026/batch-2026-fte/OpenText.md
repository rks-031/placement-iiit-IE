## Technical Round 1

The interviewer focused entirely on my projects instead of typical CS subjects. I was asked to select the most relevant project from my resume and explain it thoroughly.
My main project involved building a computer vision pipeline using CNNs, where I fine-tuned EfficientNetB0. The interviewer questioned my choice of architecture and why I preferred EfficientNetB0 over other pre-trained models.

Follow-up questions included:

* Complete model architecture
* Project workflow
* Specific novelty in the project
* How my personal contribution added value

They then shifted to ML/DL fundamentals:

* How CNNs work
* Purpose of pooling and dropout
* Architecture basics of VGG16 and EfficientNetB0
* Activation functions and why they’re needed

No questions were asked regarding DSA, DBMS, or CS Fundamentals.
No internship-related questions were asked either.
The round ended with some follow-up discussions.

## Technical Round 2

This round started with one DSA question based on hashing and character frequency matching.

**DBMS Section:**
They asked about:

* All levels of normalization
* ACID properties
* Why normalization is needed even when hardware resources are unlimited
* Full database design for a university management system
* Normalizing the design step-by-step
* SQL queries involving sorting, joins, and window functions

**Domain Questions:**
Questions on ML, DL, and GenAI:

* Transformer models
* RAG pipelines
* GANs and their purpose
* Difference between generalized and specialized models
* Why we fine-tune pre-trained models when generalized GPT-like models exist
* How agentic models differ from conventional ML models and GPT systems

**Internship Discussion:**
They asked about my SDE internship at BigBinary (Ruby on Rails + React):

* Why I interned as a full-stack developer if I wanted AI/ML
* Leadership, conflict handling, and teamwork experiences

**Personal & Background Questions:**
They asked about:

* My family background
* Where I live, native place
* Parents’ professions
* Siblings
* My final year project
* Motivation behind AI/ML
* My free-time activities
* Location preference (Hyderabad/Bangalore)

The round ended with a few questions I wanted to ask them.

## HR Round

The HR round was extremely casual and friendly.

### Introduction & Background

They asked about:

* My schooling (10th, 12th, JEE journey)
* Academic performance
* Native place and current residence

A long informal conversation happened about Puri, food, sweets, travel spots, and preferences.
They jokingly asked me to bring Rasogulla on my joining day.

### Behavioral Questions

They talked about:

* Hobbies
* Anime/manga and why the younger generation loves it
* Games I play (outdoor, indoor, video games)
* Motivation for AI/ML

### Technical + Scenario Question

They asked me to design a fully automatic mall parking system with zero manual involvement:

* Components
* Reservation system
* Emergency flow
* Complete workflow

This connected well with my final-year project, leading to more casual discussion.

### Ending

Location preference was asked again.
I chose Bangalore.
They gave Hyderabad… with a smile.

## Extra Note

Be yourself and don’t panic.
It is completely fine to say *“I don’t know”* rather than guessing something wrong.
Over-explaining incorrect logic will hurt you more.

*ALL THE BEST!*
