## Online Assessment Round  

- **Duration**: 90 minutes  
- **Content**: 3 DSA Questions (Hashmaps, Graph, etc.)  
- **Mode**: Offline (In Placement Cell)  


---

## Technical Round 1  

- **Duration**: 60–70 minutes  
- Round started with a short introduction, then moved directly to DSA questions.  

### Question 1 – Pairwise Destruction of Strings (Monotonic Stack)  
- **Problem**: Given an array of `n` strings `arr[]`, determine the number of words remaining after pairwise destruction.  
  - If two consecutive words are identical, they cancel each other out until no eliminations are possible.  
- **Example**:  
  - Input: `["gfg", "for", "geeks", "geeks", "for"]`  
  - Output: `1`  
  - Explanation:  
    - After 1st iteration → `[gfg, for, for]`  
    - After 2nd iteration → `[gfg]` → result = 1  

- **Approach**: Proposed a **stack-based solution**, explained time & space complexity, and implemented it. Solution was accepted within 5 minutes.

### Question 2 – Text Justification (LeetCode Hard)  
- **Problem**: Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `maxWidth`, format the text so each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully justified.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Pack words greedily into lines.  
  - Distribute spaces as evenly as possible.  
  - If uneven, assign more spaces to the left.  
  - Last line must be **left-justified**.  
- **Example**:  
  - Input: `words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]`, `maxWidth = 16`  
  - Output:  
    ```
    [
       "This    is    an",
       "example  of text",
       "justification.  "
    ]
    ```  

- **Approach**: Initially got stuck, but after clarification solved it optimally using **greedy + string formatting**.
