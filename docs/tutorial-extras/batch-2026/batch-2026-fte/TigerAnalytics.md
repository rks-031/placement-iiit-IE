## Round 2: Technical Interview – 2  

- The interviewer gave me a **choice** between:
  - **Structured Data questions**, or  
  - **Unstructured Data questions**.  
  I chose **Structured Data**, explaining my preference and reasoning.

### Question:  
Given the **class** and **height of students** in each class (e.g., 6th grade, 7th grade, etc.), prove the hypothesis that when students move to higher classes, their **height increases**.

- **My Approach:**  
  Take the **mean of the heights** of students grouped by class and compare across grades.  

### Follow-up Question:  
> For 6th standard, the average height is 95.  
> For 7th standard, the 5 students have individual heights such that their **average is less than 95**.  
> How would you handle this situation?  

I explained how such cases can be handled using:
- **Statistical analysis** (checking sample size, outliers, etc.), or  
- **Hypothesis testing** to validate trends.

### Additional Question:
- Explain the **role of Hypothesis Testing** in **Linear Regression**.
