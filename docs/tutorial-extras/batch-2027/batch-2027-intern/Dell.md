### Project Discussion  

#### **Project 1: Uber Demand Prediction**  
- End-to-end project involving preprocessing of a large city dataset.  
- Performed **EDA** and built a model to predict the likelihood of a driver getting a customer after reaching their destination.  

**Key Questions**:  
- What were the input features in your dataset?  
- How did you perform clustering?  
- How did you analyze the dataset?  
- How does your model handle unpredictable patterns, such as increased passenger demand at night?  

At one point, I struggled with an answer, but the interviewers helped guide me to an optimized approach.  

#### **Project 2: Cryptocurrency Analysis**  
- Conducted complete data analysis on a crypto dataset and built an end-to-end project.  

**Interview Questions**:  
- Why did you choose this project?  
- How did you implement it?  

I explained terms like **volatility**, focusing on the **logic and implementation strategy** rather than exact code syntax.  
> **Note**: The interviewers were more interested in thought process and implementation strategy than the exact syntax.
