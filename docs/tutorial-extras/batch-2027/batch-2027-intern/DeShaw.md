## Interview Process  

### Online Assessment Round  
- **Duration**: 90–100 minutes  
- **Content**:  
  - **MCQs (15)**: Based on **OOP concepts, DBMS, OS concepts & implementations**, and basic algorithms like hashing.  
  - **DSA Questions (2)**:  
    - One based on **Greedy + Implementation**.

### Technical Round 1  

#### DSA Questions  
- **Question 1**:  
  - Problem: Given `n` bags where the `i-th` bag contains `arr[i]` balls. A person can either pick or not pick a bag, and if picked, can choose any number of balls in range `[1, arr[i]]`. Find the **total count of distinct sums** possible.  
  - Solution: Solved using **Backtracking + global set** (Pick/Not Pick DP on Subsequences). Needed optimization using Math.  

- **Question 2**:  
  - Problem: An **8×8 chessboard** with a bishop at coordinate `(x,y)`. Find the **minimum number of moves** required to reach any one of the four boundary cells.  
  - Solution: Solved using **Observation + Greedy thinking**, but missed some edge cases.  

---

#### DBMS Questions  
- Explained **Normalization** in relational database tables in detail:  
  - Different **normal forms** and how normalization is performed.  
  - Why normalization is needed → prevention of anomalies.  
  - Discussion of **anomalies**: Insertion, Update, Deletion.  
  - Discussion on **redundancy** and its causes in relational tables.  

---

#### Operating System Questions  
- **Thread Memory Isolation & Protection**:  
  - Interaction of **stack, heap, code, and data** between threads.  
  - Example: Two threads `T1` and `T2` running recursive code → explained **stack and heap interactions**.  
  - Mention of **Thread Control Block (TCB)** maintained by OS.  
- **Process Memory Isolation & Protection**.  
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**:  
  - Discussed **pipes, named pipes (FIFO), shared memory, and message passing** with their differences.  

---

#### Project Discussion  
- Asked about a project from resume:  
  - General: Motivation, problem it solves, and working mechanism.  
  - Specific: How the project serves its purpose when coupled with an **external service**.  

---

## Extra Notes  
- Study **Core CS subjects in depth**, especially **Operating Systems and its applications**.  
- Strengthen **problem-solving skills** in both **DSA** and **Aptitude**.
