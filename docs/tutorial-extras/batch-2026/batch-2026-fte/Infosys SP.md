# Infosys Specialist Programmer (SP) Interview Experience

**Company**: Infosys  
**Role**: Specialist Programmer (SP)  
**Mode**: On-campus (Placement Cell) with active invigilation by Infosys employees  

---

## Online Assessment Round

**Duration:** 3 Hours  
**Mode:** Online (conducted in placement cell with active invigilation)

### Pattern
- No MCQs  
- No Aptitude  
- **4 DSA Coding Questions**: Easy, Medium, Hard, Complex  

### Shortlisting Criteria
- **Complex + Hard** → SP L3  
- **Complex + Medium** → SP L2  
- **Hard + Medium** → SP L1  
- **Easy + Medium** → DSE  

I solved **Easy, Medium, and Hard** (Hard with partial test cases) and got shortlisted for **SP L1**.  
The questions were genuinely challenging and required strong problem-solving skills.

## Question Types

1. **Easy** — *Math + Range Queries* (LeetCode Medium)  
   - LCM of a range and counting its divisors  

2. **Medium** — *Tree + String Matching* (LeetCode Hard)  
   - Root-to-leaf path strings with minimum mismatch cost queries  

3. **Hard** — *Dynamic Programming* (LeetCode Hard)  
   - Maximum profit from two sequences with constraints on consecutive picks  

4. **Complex** — *Tree + Bitmask Optimization + String Matching*  
   *(Beyond LeetCode Hard)*  
   - Optimized mismatch calculation using bit manipulation on tree paths

## Technical Interview – Round 1

**Mode:** Offline  
**Duration:** 1 Hour  
**Focus:** DSA + CS Fundamentals  

### DSA Questions
- Merge Sort and its time complexity  
- Two Sum problem:
  - Solved using HashMap approach  
  - Follow-up: Why not two-pointer approach?  
    - Answered: Only applicable if the array is sorted  
  - Follow-up: Why prioritize time over space complexity?
    - Explained trade-off:  
      - O(n log n) time, O(1) space if sorting is used  
      - Time complexity is generally more critical than space complexity  
- Number of nodes in a tree  
- Finding distance between a source and a node in a graph  
- Finding unique elements in an array  
- Heap insertion, properties, and time complexity  

### CS Fundamentals
- **OOPs:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction  
- **Operating Systems:** Process scheduling and context switching  

### Projects
- Not asked in my case due to time constraints  
- Some of my friends were asked about their projects

## HR Discussion

- **Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**  
  I answered that I want to be in a position where my skills and continuous learning make me hard to replace in the fast-changing tech industry, take ownership, grow into leadership roles, and share my knowledge.

- **Any question for us?**  
  I asked why Infosys invests heavily in training freshers and how the experience is for new joiners.

---

## Preparation Strategy

- **DSA:** Striver DSA Sheet  
- **SQL:** LeetCode Top 50 SQL  
- **Core CS:** Apna College notes  

---

## Key Takeaways

- Be honest and confident, especially during HR discussions  
- A strong HR round leaves a lasting impression and helps interviewers provide positive feedback

## Online Assessment Questions (Detailed)

### 1. Easy Type — Math + Range Queries  
**Difficulty:** LeetCode Medium  

**Description:**  
Given an integer array and multiple range queries, for each query compute the LCM of the elements in the range and count the number of its divisors. Return the sum of these values modulo `10^9 + 7`.

---

### 2. Medium Type — Tree + String Matching  
**Difficulty:** LeetCode Hard  

**Description:**  
Given a rooted tree where each node contains a digit, form all root-to-leaf strings. For each query string, find the minimum cost to match it with any substring of these paths, where the cost depends on the number of mismatches. Return the total cost.

---

### 3. Hard Type — Dynamic Programming  
**Difficulty:** LeetCode Hard  

**Description:**  
You are given two sequences of products with profits `A` and `B`. You can pick products one by one from either sequence, but you cannot sell two consecutive products. Find the maximum total profit achievable.

---

### 4. Complex Type — Tree + Bitmask Optimization + String Matching  
**Difficulty:** Harder than LeetCode Hard (Codeforces ~2000)  

**Description:**  
Given a rooted binary-valued tree, form all root-to-leaf binary strings. For each query string, find the minimum mismatches with any substring of these paths using bitmask optimization, compute the required flips, and return the total cost.
