## Interview Process  

We had only 1 round which consisted of both technical and HR questions. These are the questions asked during the interview:  

### Technical Questions  

- **Solution to your food problems in the hostel**:  
  - The interviewer asked me to design a basic structure of an application to solve the current problems of food availability in my college.  
  - My approach: First filter students based on their respective food preferences (e.g., for out-of-state students in IIIT), then group them and search for food facilities available nearby them.  

- **Application Security**:  
  - How would you make your application more secure?  
  - My answer: By implementing authentication and authorization in the app.  

- **Basic Database Questions**:  
  - Questions on cloud computing and physical server security.  

- **Resume-Based Questions**:  
  - On my achievement as a FATS secretary: What acts have you performed?  
    - Follow-up: How would you make a robot do acting?  
    - My answer: Robots can’t completely act like humans since they lack advanced facial receptors and body language capabilities. However, we can train them to understand the basic emotions behind a script using NLP and sentiment analysis models.  
  
  - **Tech used in my projects**:  
    - The interviewer focused on the Machine Learning part of my projects.  
    - Follow-up: Why did you use the specific ML models in your projects?

### HR Questions  

- **Preparation Tip**:  
  - Always research the company before any interview: Understand the services/products the company offers and the technologies it uses.  

- **Possible Questions to HR**:  
  - If allowed, ask questions such as:  
    - “What exactly would I be doing in the company if assigned to a specific team?”  
    - “Are there any current projects the company is working on?”  

- **How do you rate your interview on a scale of 10?**  
  - My answer: 9/10.  
  - Follow-up: Why 9?  
  - My reply: I could have been more precise if I had more time to work on the app design question.
