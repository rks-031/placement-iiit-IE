## Online Assessment Round  

**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Mode:** Online  

I don’t remember the exact questions, but the **DSA problems** were mostly **easy to medium level**, similar to **LeetCode** problems.

## Round 1: System Design Test (Written Round – 45 Minutes)  

### Details about the Round  
Candidates were given **two system design questions** and had to choose **one** to answer in detail.  

### Questions Asked  

1. **Design a High-Level Design (HLD) for Paytm**  
2. **Design an Application for Housing Society / Residential Complex Management**  

#### Problem Statement (Brief)  
In residential societies, residents face issues managing daily utilities and services such as garbage collection, water supply, and grocery needs. There is no unified platform for raising complaints, requesting services, or tracking updates, causing communication gaps and inefficiencies.  

The goal was to design a **mobile app/website** that allows residents to:  
- Raise service requests and complaints  
- Track their status  
- Communicate with management  
- Access essential utilities

### My Answer  

I wrote the answers **clearly and comprehensively**, covering:  
- **Chosen tech stack and reasoning**  
- **Alternative technologies**  
- **Architecture and scalability** considerations  

Because of the clarity and depth in my explanation, the interviewers **did not ask any follow-up questions** from my design sheet.  

#### Example (My Approach)  
- **Frontend:** Flutter – chosen for its **cross-platform capability**, reducing both cost and time (works for Android, iOS, and Web).  
- **ML Model:** Used **CNN** for recommendations (automated pattern recognition).  
- **Backend:** **FastAPI** for its **auto-documentation** and Python compatibility (easy synchronization with ML models).  
- **Authentication:** Included login/signup with user roles.  
- **Chatting Feature:** Added for customer service support.  
- **Admin Panel:** Displays user logs and status updates.  
- **Containerization:** Used **Docker** to make the app scalable.  

Also added features like **rating system**, **feedback module**, and **flowchart diagrams** to explain user–system interaction.  

> 💡 **Tip for Incture System Design Round:**  
> Always include multiple features, ML components, and a rating system. Mention tech stack reasoning and alternatives.

## Technical Round 1 (Offline – Pen and Paper)  

### DSA Questions  

1. **Reverse a String**  
   - Mentioned **three approaches:**  
     1. Using STL function: `reverse(a.begin(), a.end());`  
     2. Using a custom function and `swap()` from STL.  
     3. Defining `swap()` manually in a separate function.  
   - Explained when to use each — highlighting **readability** and **maintainability** for the 3rd method.  
   - The interviewer appreciated the detailed understanding and practical insights.  

2. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**  
   - Explained the solution with a **diagram** for better clarity.  

The interviewers **complimented my system design** answers for including advanced concepts like **FastAPI** and **Docker**, and asked follow-up questions about them.

### Technical Discussions  

- **FastAPI:** Explained that it’s built using **Pydantic** (for data validation) and **Starlette** (for async capabilities). Discussed its structure and advantages in detail.  
- **Docker:** Explained **Dockerfile format**, **image creation**, and **containerization** benefits.  
- **Major Project:** Discussed my **ML/DL-based project** built using **Flutter** (mobile app).  
  - Explained **ML vs DL**:  
    - **ML** → for smaller datasets, transparent model interpretation.  
    - **DL** → for larger datasets, automatic feature extraction, less interpretability.  
  - **Live Demo:** Ran the app on my phone, which impressed the panel.  

- **DBMS:** Basic SQL queries and **ACID** property explanation.  
- **CS Fundamentals:** Not asked.  

Also discussed **APIs** — explained their **purpose**, **origin**, and **working mechanism** with real-world context, which impressed the interviewers.
